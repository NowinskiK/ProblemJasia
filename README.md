## Atari

"Johnny's Problem" ("Problem Jasia") is an arcade-puzzle game released in 1993 by Mirage Software for the "small" (8-bit) Atari. The game quickly gained popularity due to its very good graphics (for its time) and extremely original and catchy music. The entire project was created by one person, then 22-year-old [Jakub Husak](http://atariki.krap.pl/index.php/Jakub_Husak).  

## PC edition (Desktop for Windows, 2022)

In 2022, it was time to create a remake of this popular game for the PC Windows platform. And so began several hours of programming a few days before leaving for vacation. Then came a dozen more hours of fixes (some during vacation, some during the return flight to the UK), a few consultations with Jakub (thx!) and others from the Atari community on [atarionline.pl](http://atarionline.pl/) forum, and the game was ready.

## Web edition (2025)
So there I was, armed with Cursor, VSCode, and my trusty AI sidekick GitHub Copilot, when I thought:
"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if AI could turn my C# Windows game into a web thing?" ü§î

My first chat with ChatGPT went something like:
"Yo, AI buddy! Can you help me turn this C# Windows Forms game into a web app?"

To my surprise, the AI didn't just nod and smile - it actually understood the game's rules and logic better than some of my human colleagues! That got me thinking: "Why not go all in and let AI help me remake the whole thing as a web page?"

What followed was a few days of what is nowadays the new buzzword "vibe-coding" - just me, a dozen or so prompts, and my AI pals turning my C# dreams into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript reality. And get this - I had never written a single line of JavaScript before! But after spending some time reading JavaScript code, I got pretty good at speaking "AI language" and asking for the right tweaks.

Plot twist: Despite being a JavaScript newbie, between me and the AI, we squashed bugs like pros! üêõüí™
