 
What a problem !!!
Little Johnny wants to
make a birthday present
for Margaret.
Margaret has just turned
ten years old and she is now
grown-up !!!
For this special occasion, little Johnny 
bought 12 posters at the store,
paid 960,000 polish zloty for them.
He came back home, hid the posters
and went out to buy flowers.
But what do you have
younger brothers for?
Little Kaz came back from the yard
and found Johnny's posters.
Then his wild eyes
stopped at the table,
where large scissors
were lying.
What happened next?
Better not ask.
Johnny has a lot of work now.
(he's already dealt with Kaz)
He must piece together the posters,
so Margaret will be happy.
He surely can't do it alone.
You must help him.
And since Johnny is lazy, he will
sit with his arms folded
and watch how you're doing.
Sometimes he'll drop a word or two.

Remember, Johnny is counting on you!

"Can AI agent (chat gpt or claude LLM) 
convert my simple game written in C#
(Win forms) to web application?"

This was my first question to ChatGPT.

AI was asked to analyze
the game code written in C# for Windows.

It accurately described the rules and logic
of the game, which encouraged me to try
converting all the code to a static web page.

Therefore, most of the code was created
using vibe-coding over a few days
with just a dozen prompts.

Code: HTML + CSS + JavaScript.

I had never programmed in JavaScript before.
However, reading and understanding
this language helped me in asking
the right prompts to improve the code.

Expect soon
a video material on YouTube
about the whole process
of building the game with AI.
