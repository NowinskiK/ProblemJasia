 
What a problem !!!
Little Johnny wants to
make a birthday present
for Margaret.
Margaret has just turned
ten years old and she is now
grown-up !!!
For this special occasion, little Johnny 
bought 12 posters at the store,
paid 960,000 polish zloty for them.
He came back home, hid the posters
and went out to buy flowers.
But what do you have
younger brothers for?
Little Kaz came back from the yard
and found Johnny's posters.
Then his wild eyes
stopped at the table,
where large scissors
were lying.
What happened next?
Better not ask.
Johnny has a lot of work now.
(he's already dealt with Kaz)
He must piece together the posters,
so Margaret will be happy.
He surely can't do it alone.
You must help him.
And since Johnny is lazy, he will
sit with his arms folded
and watch how you're doing.
Sometimes he'll drop a word or two.

Remember, Johnny is counting on you!
